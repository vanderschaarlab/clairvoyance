    "\n",
    "This notebook describes a user-guide for treatment effects estimation using the Clairvoyance framework. We consider the case of time-varying treatments where, given static and temporal features we want to estimate the effect of a single treatment or a sequence of treatments on the patient outcome. For instance, using the static data (demographic information), temporal data (vitals, lab tests) and treatments administered over time, we can estimate whether the patient will need the ventilator under different possible treatment plans. These counterfactual trajectories can then be used to decide which treatment plan will give the best patient outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Rolling window counterfactual prediction:\n",
    "  - Example: Predict the effect of a sequence of treatments on the probability of the patient needing a ventilator. The projection horizon is equal to the length of the sequence of treatments for which we make the counterfactual predictions. \n",

    "### Temporal and static datasets for training and testing\n",
    "\n",
    "If users come with their own temporal and static datasets for training and testing, the users should save those files as 'data_name_temporal_train_data_eav.csv.gz', 'data_name_static_train_data.csv.gz', 'data_name_temporal_test_data_eav.csv.gz', 'data_name_static_test_data.csv.gz' in '../datasets/data/data_name/' directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the temporal data should contain information about the treatments administered over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions needed for performing causal inference\n",
    "For the selected temoporal data, users should check the necesary assumptions for performing causal inference using the data, namely overlap (positivity) and no hidden confounders. Overlap means that at each timestep, each patient has non-zero probability of being assigned each treatment option, no hidden confounders involves considering all variables that are affecting the treatment assignment and patient outcome at each timestep. \n",
    "If these assumptions do not hold, they will obtain bias estimates of the treatment effects. \n",

    "### Step 1: Load dataset\n",
    "  - Extract csv files from the original raw datasets in ../datasets/data/data_name/ directory.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Step 2: Preprocess dataset\n",
    "  - Preprocessing the raw data using various filters such as (1) replacing negative values to NaN, (2) do one-hot encidng for certain features, (3) do normalization.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Step 3: Define problem\n",
    "  - Set the time-series prediction problem that we want to solve. For treatment effects, we only consider the 'online' prediction problem as we are interested in estimating counterfactual outcomes at different timesteps throughtout the patient trajectory. In addition, set the label, set the maximum sequence length, and set the features in the temporal dataset that should be considered as treatments. We also define the metric for evaluation and the task itself (whether classification or regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Impute dataset\n",
    "  - Impute missing values in the preprocessed static and temporal datasets and return complete datasets.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Step 5: Feature selection\n",
    "  - Select the relevant static and temporal features to the labels. You can skip the feature selection (set feature selection method = None). For causal infernece, if feature selection is performed, one needs to ensure that the remaining features still satisfy the required identifiability assumptions. \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Step 6: Treatment effects model fit and predict\n",
    "  - After finishing the data preparation, we define the treatment effects models and train the model using the training dataset. The models capable of estimating counterfactual outcomes for a sequence of treatments into the future will have the option for selecting the projection horizon. After training, we use the trained model to estimating treatment effects on the testing dataset.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Step 7: Visualize results\n",
    "  - Visualize the various results such as performance, factual and counterfactual predictions and uncertainties."
